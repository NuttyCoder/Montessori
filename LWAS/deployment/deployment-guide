📅 Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Core System Development (Weeks 1-6)
✅ Set Up Backend Infrastructure (FastAPI/Django)
✅ Define Database Schema (PostgreSQL for tracking learning progress)
✅ Develop APIs for Assessments & Reports (Student scoring, milestone tracking)
✅ Create Teacher Dashboard (Web) (Insights, reports, learning recommendations)
Phase 2: Student Learning UI (Weeks 7-12)
✅ Build Interactive Test Modules (React Native for tablet-based assessments)
✅ Integrate Adaptive Learning Logic (AI-driven difficulty adjustments)
✅ Develop Voice-Guided Story Prompts (Expo Speech for Montessori learning cues)
✅ Implement Gamified Learning & Rewards (Progress bars, animations)
Phase 3: Hybrid Digital-Physical Learning (Weeks 13-18)
✅ Sync Real-World Activities with Digital Prompts (Hands-on learning integrations)
✅ Develop Teacher Tools for Classroom Management (Monitor digital vs. physical engagement)
✅ Enhance Parent Reports for Take-Home Learning Suggestions (Printable guides, milestones)
✅ Conduct Pilot Testing in Montessori Classrooms (User feedback & improvements)
Phase 4: Deployment, Testing & Scaling (Weeks 19-24)
✅ Optimize System for Multi-Device Use (Ensure iPads/Tablets work seamlessly)
✅ Launch Beta Testing & Gather User Feedback (Refine based on teacher/student insights)
✅ Deploy Scalable Cloud Infrastructure (AWS ECS, ECR, and Fargate for cloud hosting)
✅ Release Final Version & Plan Continuous Iterations (Expanding story arcs, adding more activities)
🚀 Deployment Strategies
1️⃣ Cloud-Based Infrastructure
✅ AWS Deployment (ECS/Fargate) – Ensures scalability & security for student data storage.
✅ Containerization (Docker) – Allows efficient updates & version control.
✅ Database Backup & Security Measures – Regular snapshots & encryption for student data protection.
2️⃣ Multi-Device Support & Accessibility
✅ Optimize for Tablets/iPads – Ensure Montessori assessments work seamlessly on touchscreen devices.
✅ Enable Offline Functionality – Teachers can still log assessments without internet & sync later.
✅ Adaptive Display Scaling – Supports various screen sizes for flexible classroom use.
3️⃣ Continuous Improvement & Versioning
✅ Monitor Classroom Usage Trends – Gather insights to refine AI-driven recommendations.
✅ Expand Learning Paths Based on Feedback – Add new Montessori-inspired challenges as teachers request them.
✅ Automate AI Learning Adjustments – Ensure adaptive testing remains dynamically personalized.
